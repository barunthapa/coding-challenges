## Challenges

1. **CH001 :: Weird Number**

	A weird number is defined as a number, n, such that the sum of all its divisors (excluding n itself) is greater than n, but no subset of its divisors sums up to exactly n.
Write a program that finds weird numbers between given range. Example: lower number 10, maximum number 100

2. **CH002 :: Pythagorean Triplet**

	A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
	`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

	For example, `3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2`

	There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
	Write a program to find this special pythagorean triplet: a, b, c.


3. **CH003 :: Number Splitter**
	
	Write a program that divides a given integer number(N) into specified parts(X) so that the numbers sum up to be N. The divided numbers should be integer greater than 0. All the numbers are integers. Constraint X <= N, N > 0.
	For Example: Divide number 10(N) into 4(X) pieces
	```	
	N = 10, X = 4
	=> [5, 2, 2, 1]
	```
	
4. **CH004 :: Happy Number**
	
	Write a program that tells whether a given integer is happy. A happy number is found using the following process: Take the sum of the squares of its digits, and continue iterating this process until it yields 1, or produces an infinite loop. If it yields 1, then it is a Happy Number! else it is a sad number.

	For example the number 7 is a happy number because:
	```
	7^2 = 49
	4^2 + 9^2 = 97
	9^2 + 7^2 = 130
	1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 10
	1^2 + 0^2 = 1
	```

5. **CH005 :: Curious Number**
	
	A n-digit number is said to be curious if the last n digits of its square are the same as the original number.
	For example, `25^2 = 625` and `76^2 = 5776`.
	(Curious numbers are also known as automorphic numbers.)
	An example of 9 digit number:
	`212890625^2 = 45322418212890625`
	Write a program to find all Curious Numbers of 1 to 10 digits.


6. **CH006 :: Weird Number**

	A weird number is defined as a number, n, such that the sum of all its divisors (excluding n itself) is greater than n, but no subset of its divisors sums up to exactly n.
	Write a program that finds weird numbers between and including 10-100. You can extend it upto 1000.
	Example: `n = 12`
	Divisors => [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
	Sum of Divisors => 16; > 12
	Sum of Subset => [2, 4, 6] => 12 => n
	12 is not a weird number.


7. **CH007 :: LCM of numbers**

 	Write a program to take input from user to find the LCM of those numbers.
 	
	An example:
	```
	Input: 2 3 5
	Output: 30
	```
