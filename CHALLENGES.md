## Challenges

1. **CH001 :: Weird Number**

	A weird number is defined as a number, n, such that the sum of all its divisors (excluding n itself) is greater than n, but no subset of its divisors sums up to exactly n.
Write a program that finds weird numbers between given range. Example: lower number 10, maximum number 100

2. **CH002 :: Pythagorean Triplet**

	A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
	`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

	For example, `3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2`

	There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
	Write a program to find this special pythagorean triplet: a, b, c.

3. **CH003 :: LCM of numbers**

 Write a program to take input from user to find the LCM of those numbers.

 An example:
  Input: 2 3 5
  Output: 30
