## Challenge CH003

**CH003 :: Number Splitter**
	
	Write a program that divides a given integer number(N) into specified parts(X) so that the numbers sum up to be N. The divided numbers should be integer greater than 0. All the numbers are integers. Constraint X <= N, N > 0.
	For Example: Divide number 10(N) into 4(X) pieces
	```	
	N = 10, X = 4
	=> [5, 2, 2, 1]
	```
